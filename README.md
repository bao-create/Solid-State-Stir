# Solid-State-Stir
GUI.py is ross's gui code. pid.ipythn is a collab document with a few code snippets. The bottom one is the important one. Sets up the backend and the state variable class. In addition, the threading is implemented to some degree and comments denote where roughly gpio operations should occur.

Need to add clean stop button (saves data and kills tkinter and the pid and all the threads)
need to add some type of graph. Maybe just continously plot the data_log_array variable

Real files are Gui.py and tkinter_code.py
